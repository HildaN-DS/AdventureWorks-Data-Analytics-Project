This project focuses on creating a comprehensive sales report dashboard using the AdventureWorks database to analyze key business metrics such as sales trends, product performance, and regional sales distributions. The dashboard was built in Power BI, providing interactive and real-time insights for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. This repository includes all necessary files: the business request document, Power BI dashboard file, CSV datasets, and T-SQL scripts.
